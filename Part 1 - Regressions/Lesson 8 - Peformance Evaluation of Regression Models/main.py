'''
Here, we evaluate the performanc of all our regression models using key metrics
such as R-squared


R^2 = 1 - (sum of residuals)/(total sum of squares)

the closer it is to 1, the better the model


Adjusted R-Squared provides a better performance measurement compared to R-squared

the closer it is to 1, the better the model
